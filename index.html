    <h1>Health Awareness: Mental Health Awareness</h1>

    <div class="border-box">
        <p>
            Good day everyone, I am Tonie Jearynz Aquino, advocating for a particularly sensitive type of health awareness. Mental health awareness is a key factor in relieving one’s pains and struggles. It is as essential as nursing our physical being because these
            are interconnected with each other. If one’s mental state is not thriving, then it is more likely to affect one’s physical health. For example, a person who has a mental illness may encounter issues with his or her body due to psychological
            stress which affects the nervous system of a human. The cons of having to deal with a poor psychological being is far greater than the difficulty of seeking help or making changes. By being aware about our mental health, we save ourselves
            the time of suffering because of it. Mental health awareness is not only important to ourselves but to other people as well. We must consider the well-being of those who surround us for they also influence our thoughts and emotions. Looking
            after each other helps us build a better community with healthy minds that will coordinate for greater unity. Thank you.
        </p>
